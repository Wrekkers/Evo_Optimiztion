This code replicates the algorithim discussed in the research paper "Imperialist Competitive Alogorithim: An Algorithim for Optimization Inspired by Imperialistic Competition" by Esmaeil Atashpaz-Gargari and Caro Lucas.

The code is written in Python and is aimed to improve upon the logic of reaching the optimum.

This code is free to use for non-commercial purposes. For any improvements please reach out to me on: bhanu93(dot)iitd(at)gmail(dot)com.
